# Error Handling Improvements for AlgoMento Extension

## Problem Fixed
The extension was showing technical error messages like:
```
[AlgoMento Background] AI API error: Error: Gemini API error: 503
[AlgoMento Background] Error processing feature explain-approach: Error: Gemini API error: 503
[AlgoMento Background] Feature processing failed: Error: Gemini API error: 503
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced AI Provider Adapter (`ai-provider-adapter.js`)

**Added Retry Logic with Exponential Backoff:**
- Automatic retries for temporary failures (503, 502, 504, 429 errors)
- Exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 4s delays between retries
- Maximum 3 retry attempts to avoid endless loops
- Network error handling for connection issues

**Humanized Error Messages:**
- 503: "The AI service is currently experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few moments."
- 429: "You've reached the rate limit. Please wait a moment before trying again."
- 401: "Invalid API key. Please check your API configuration in the extension settings."
- 403: "Access denied. Please verify your API key has the necessary permissions."
- 404: "The AI service endpoint was not found. This might be a temporary issue."
- 500: "The AI service encountered an internal error. Please try again shortly."
- 502/504: "The AI service is temporarily unavailable. Please try again in a few minutes."

**New Methods Added:**
- `makeRequestWithRetry()` - Handles API calls with retry logic
- `getHumanizedErrorMessage()` - Converts HTTP status codes to user-friendly messages
- `isRetryableError()` - Determines if an error should trigger a retry
- `sleep()` - Utility for implementing delays

### 2. Improved Background Script (`background.js`)

**Better Error Communication:**
- Maintains technical error logging for debugging
- Sends user-friendly messages to the extension UI
- Distinguishes between API errors and other types of failures

**Enhanced Logging:**
- Clearer distinction between technical logs and user messages
- Progress indicators during retry attempts

## Benefits

### For Users:
- ✅ Clear, actionable error messages instead of technical jargon
- ✅ Automatic recovery from temporary service issues
- ✅ Better understanding of what went wrong and what to do next

### For Developers:
- ✅ Detailed technical logs still available for debugging
- ✅ Resilient API communication with built-in retry logic
- ✅ Reduced support requests due to clearer error messaging

### For Service Reliability:
- ✅ Graceful handling of high-traffic periods (503 errors)
- ✅ Respectful retry behavior that doesn't overwhelm services
- ✅ Better user experience during temporary outages

## Example Before/After

**Before:**
```
[AlgoMento Background] Feature processing failed: Error: Gemini API error: 503 Service Unavailable
```

**After:**
```
[AlgoMento] API temporarily unavailable (503). Retrying in 1000ms... (attempt 1/3)
[AlgoMento] API temporarily unavailable (503). Retrying in 2000ms... (attempt 2/3)
[AlgoMento] The AI service is currently experiencing high demand. Please try again in a few moments.
```

## Testing
Run `node test-error-handling.js` to verify the error message improvements.

## Next Steps
- Monitor user feedback on the new error messages
- Consider adding user notification UI for retry attempts
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for repeated failures
- Add metrics collection for error rates and retry success
