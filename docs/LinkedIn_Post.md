🚀 How I Leveraged AI to Build AlgoMento: Your Personal DSA Mentor for Every Coding Platform!

Like many developers, I was grinding through LeetCode problems and constantly hitting walls. Spending hours searching for explanations, waiting for forum responses, or getting stuck on approaches became my daily routine. That's when I thought: "What if I could have an AI mentor right there on the coding page?"

💡 **The Journey:**
While building this idea, I discovered LeetcoAI - a similar tool that almost made me abandon my project. But after using it, I realized the 20 daily free credits disappeared after just ONE problem! The interactive quizzes would drain everything, leaving me waiting until the next day.

That limitation sparked my determination to create something different.

🎯 **What Makes AlgoMento Special:**
✅ No credit limits or paywalls
✅ Works with YOUR choice of AI (Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
✅ You control the costs with your own API key
✅ Supports 8+ coding platforms (LeetCode, GeeksForGeeks, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.)
✅ Interactive quizzes and follow-up questions
✅ Real-time problem detection and context-aware help

🤝 **Built with AI, For Developers:**
I'll be honest - I didn't build this alone. GitHub Copilot's Claude was my coding partner throughout (thanks to the GitHub Student offer!). It's fitting that an AI-assisted project now helps other developers learn and grow.

💭 **My Philosophy:**
I didn't want fellow developers choosing between learning and money. That's why AlgoMento is open-source and works with free AI tiers. I use Gemini because of Google's generous free quota, but you choose what works for your budget.
