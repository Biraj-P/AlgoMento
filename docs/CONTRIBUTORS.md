## The Guy Who Built This

**Biraj Paul** (@Biraj-P)
- Had the original idea and built everything from scratch
- Wrote all the core code and designed the architecture
- Figured out how to make it work with different AI providers
- Designed the interface (and yes, I know I'm not a designer!)
- Still maintaining and improving it

## How This All Started

I was grinding LeetCode problems back in 2025 and kept getting stuck. I'd spend ages searching for explanations or waiting for help on forums. So I thought, "What if I could just have an AI mentor right there on the page?"

While I was working on this idea, I stumbled across something called LeetcoAI that was pretty similar to what I had in mind. At first, I thought "Well, someone already built this - maybe I should just give up on my project and use theirs instead."

So I tried LeetcoAI for a while, but man, those 20 free credits per day? They'd disappear after solving just one problem! The interactive quizzes would eat up all my credits, and I'd be stuck waiting until the next day. That's when I realized I needed to keep going with my own version.

LeetcoAI actually helped me clarify what I wanted to build - something that wouldn't limit developers or charge them for basic help. I didn't want to put fellow coders in a position where they had to choose between learning and saving money. That's why I built AlgoMento to work with any AI provider you want - you bring your own API key, you control the costs.

I personally use Gemini because Google gives out a pretty generous free tier, but the beauty is you can choose whatever works best for your budget and preferences.

To be honest, I didn't build this all by myself - I had some help from GitHub Copilot's Claude (thanks to that awesome GitHub student offer!). So in a way, AI was my coding partner throughout this project, and now it'll be my mentor too. Pretty fitting for an AI-powered coding assistant, right?

## Want to Help Out?

I love it when people want to make AlgoMento better! Here's what you need to know:

1. **I Built This**: Please remember that I (Biraj Paul) created this from scratch
2. **Attribution Matters**: If you use or modify this code, give credit where it's due
3. **MIT License**: Everything follows MIT License rules
4. **Be Respectful**: Don't claim this as your own original work - that's not cool
