# ü§ñ AlgoMento - Your AI Coding Buddy

**Ever wished you had a coding mentor sitting right next to you while solving LeetCode problems? That's exactly what I built here.**

I got tired of getting stuck on coding problems and having to search through forums or wait for help. So I created AlgoMento - it's like having an AI coding mentor that understands exactly what you're working on and can help you think through problems step by step.

## üåü What Makes AlgoMento Special

- **üéØ Works Everywhere**: I made sure it works on all the coding sites I actually use - LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, GeeksforGeeks, you name it
- **ü§ñ Your Choice of AI**: Don't like being locked into one AI? Neither do I. Works with Gemini, OpenAI, Claude, and more
- **üí¨ Actually Usable Chat**: No tiny popup windows here - I built a proper chat interface that doesn't get in your way
- **üß† Knows What You're Doing**: It automatically figures out what problem you're working on (no copy-pasting required)
- **‚ö° Quick Actions**: Copy responses, ask follow-ups, get hints - all with one click
- **üìö Learn While You Code**: Interactive quizzes pop up after explanations to make sure you actually get it
- **üé® Looks Good**: I spent way too much time making this look nice, with themes and smooth animations

## üöÄ Getting Started

> **üí° Want the quick version?** Jump to **[QUICK_SETUP](QUICK_SETUP.md)** - it's way faster!

*This section has all the details if you want to understand everything that's happening.*

### What You'll Need
- Chrome browser (sorry Firefox users, maybe someday!)
- Internet connection (obviously)
- An AI API key - I recommend Gemini since Google gives out free ones

### 1. Get Your AI Access (Pick What Works for You)

#### Option A: Google Gemini (This is what I use - it's free!)
1. Head over to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Hit "Create API Key"
4. Copy that key somewhere safe

#### Option B: Other AI Services (If you're already using them)
- **OpenAI**: [Platform OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
- **Anthropic**: [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
- **Cohere**: [Cohere Dashboard](https://dashboard.cohere.ai/api-keys)

### 2. Set Up the Extension

1. **Download this project** (fork it if you want to contribute later!)
2. **Configure your API key**:
   ```bash
   # Copy the template file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit the .env file and replace the placeholder with your real key
   # Change 'your_gemini_api_key_here' to your actual key
   ```
3. **Load it into Chrome**:
   - Open Chrome and type `chrome://extensions/` in the address bar
   - Flip the "Developer mode" switch (top right)
   - Click "Load unpacked"
   - Select the AlgoMento folder you just set up
   - You should see it appear in your extensions list

### 3. Start Solving Problems!

1. Go to any coding site (LeetCode, HackerRank, whatever you prefer)
2. Look for the little AlgoMento robot button ü§ñ that appears
3. Click it and start chatting with your new AI coding buddy
4. Ask it anything - "explain this problem", "is my approach right?", "what are the edge cases?"

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env file)

```bash
# Required: At least one API key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_actual_gemini_key_here

# Optional: Additional providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key_here

# Model enablement (set to true/false)
MODEL_GEMINI=true
MODEL_OPENAI=false
MODEL_ANTHROPIC=false

# Default settings
DEFAULT_PROVIDER=gemini
DEFAULT_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

### Manual Configuration (Alternative)

If `.env` setup doesn't work, you can manually configure through Chrome:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12) on any supported coding site
2. Go to Console tab
3. Run this command with your API key:
   ```javascript
   chrome.storage.local.set({ 'GEMINI_API_KEY': 'your_actual_api_key_here' });
   ```

## üîç When Things Don't Work (Troubleshooting)

> **üí° Quick tip:** If you're having setup problems, try the **[QUICK_SETUP](QUICK_SETUP.md)** guide first - it usually fixes most issues!

### Extension Won't Start?
1. **Double-check your API key** - Make sure it's actually in the `.env` file
2. **Reload the extension** - Go to `chrome://extensions/` and hit that reload button
3. **Check the console** - Press F12 and look for any red error messages
4. **Check permissions** - The extension needs internet access to talk to the AI

### Common Headaches and How I Fixed Them

#### "API key not configured" (I see this one a lot)
- Open your `.env` file and make sure your API key is actually there
- Try the manual setup method I mentioned above
- Double-check that you saved the file (I've forgotten to save more times than I care to admit)

#### The extension icon isn't showing up
- Make sure you're on a supported site (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
- Refresh the page after loading the extension
- Check if the extension is actually enabled in Chrome

#### AI isn't responding to me
- Your API key might be invalid or out of credits
- Check your internet connection (obvious, but you'd be surprised)
- Look for error messages in the browser console (F12)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Extension Not Loading / Service Worker Errors
If you see service worker registration errors:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for specific error messages
4. If you see "window is not defined" errors, the extension files may be corrupted
5. Try reloading the extension or re-downloading

#### API Key Issues
- **"No API key configured"**: Enter your API key in the popup settings
- **"Invalid API key"**: Verify your key is correct and has proper permissions
- **"Rate limit exceeded"**: Wait a few minutes or try a different model

#### Chat Not Appearing
1. Refresh the coding platform page
2. Check if the problem is detected (look for problem title)
3. Verify the extension icon shows as active
4. Try clicking on a problem statement to trigger detection

#### No Response from AI
1. Check your internet connection
2. Verify API key is working with a simple test
3. Try switching to a different AI model
4. Check if you've hit API rate limits

### Testing Extension Health
Open `test-compatibility.html` in your browser to verify all components are working correctly.
