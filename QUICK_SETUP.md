# 🚀 AlgoMento - Let's Get You Set Up Fast

## ⚡ 7 Minutes and You're Coding with AI

I know you're probably eager to try this out, so I made the setup as quick as possible. Here's how to get AlgoMento running on your machine in about 7 minutes.

### 1. Grab the Code (2 minutes)
#### Option A: Fork from GitHub (I recommend this way)
- Head to my [AlgoMento repository](https://github.com/Biraj-P/AlgoMento)
- Click that **"Fork"** button up in the corner
- Now you've got your own copy to play with
- Download it with **"Code"** → **"Download ZIP"** or if you're a git person:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/AlgoMento.git
  ```
- Unzip it somewhere you won't forget

#### Option B: Just Download It
- Grab the files directly from my repository
- Extract them to a folder on your computer

#### Why Fork? (You'll thank me later)
- 🔄 **Easy Updates**: Pull in my latest improvements when I add them
- 🤝 **Give Back**: Found a bug or want to add something cool? Send me a pull request!
- 🛡️ **Your Version**: Customize it however you want without messing up the original
- 📝 **Keep Track**: Git will remember what you changed

### 2. Get Your AI Key (2 minutes)
- Visit [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
- Sign in → Create API Key → Copy it (seriously, it's that simple)

### 3. Configure Everything (2 minutes)
- Find that AlgoMento folder you just downloaded
- Open `setup.html` in your browser (just double-click it)
- Paste your API key → Click "Configure AlgoMento"

### 4. Add to Chrome (1 minute)
- Open Chrome and go to `chrome://extensions/`
- Turn on "Developer mode" (switch in the top right)
- Click "Load unpacked" → Pick your AlgoMento folder

### 5. Start Solving Problems!
- Go to LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, or any of the other sites I support
- Look for the 🤖 button that shows up
- Click it and ask your first question!

## 🆘 Having Trouble?

### Quick Fixes for Common Issues
- **API key acting up**: Use that setup.html tool again
- **Extension won't load**: Double-check chrome://extensions/
- **AI not responding**: Make sure your API key is working in setup.html

### If the Easy Way Doesn't Work
Sometimes the automated setup gets confused. Here's the manual way:
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Open the `.env` file and replace `your_gemini_api_key_here` with your actual key
3. Reload the extension in Chrome
